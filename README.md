# E-Diary
Purpose:
The purpose of this app is to serve as a virtual diary for users who prefer to go digital instead of using paper. All entries are saved to their device's local storage

CORE FEATURES:
- View an Entry: Allows the user to select a date of an entry they want to see
- Write Today's Entry: Allows the user to create today's entry. If they wrote an entry already, then they will be alerted to use "Edit an Entry" instead
- Edit an Entry: Allows the user to edit any entry of a selected date
- Delete an Entry: Allows the user to view and delete an entry for a selected date. There is also a confirmation prompt that the user must select "Ok" after reading to delete the entry

Why I made this and what I learned:
I never made a JavaScript Project before, and this idea was something that I found to be interesting to go for, especially since I could actively detail my progress within the project by 
writing entries about it, too. 

I learned a lot about DOM manipulation, how HTML, CSS, and JS work together, and why you'd want to hide/show features. 

My future Plans with this project:
I would like to use the cloud to save user data instead of on local storage to save on data. Furthermore, I would like to integrate SQL into this project, which I have pre-prepared for by having each An 
Entry has its very own special ID upon creation. Perhaps the SQL can allow someone to find entries between certain months, find entries pertaining to people/objects, etc.
